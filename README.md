# JSONConverter
## Desktop app in collaboration with Shoreline (shoreline.no)

Shoreline had a problem. Companies were giving them data in different file formats like XML, CSV, or excel, and they 
had to manually rewrite those data into JSON format.

This application converts various types of files (CSV, XML,..) into JSON file and therefore saves valuable time which would 
otherwise be used for a manual conversion.

- Built using JavaFX, connected to MSSQL.
- MVC in 3-Tier architecture was chosen.
